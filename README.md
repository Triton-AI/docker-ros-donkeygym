Getting some ROS-based algorithms to run in DonkeyGym.

Paul and Michael: Please open Dockerfile and edit as needed. Some tasks are commented in there.

VS code has extension for docker and works well for me.

To test build: `docker build . -t [name]`

Run intereactive mode  `docker run -it [name]`
